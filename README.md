# Learning how to write a compiler

Writing a Lexer - Parser - Interpreter should provide me a better grasp about usage of Trees and how to manage a growing set of functionalty. Coding in a way to keep tings extendable etc.

C# is currently subject in my education and the video-guide by [Immo Landwerth](https://www.youtube.com/@ImmoLandwerth) sounds like a good side project to follow along myself

- The video guide: https://github.com/terrajobst/minsk/tree/master/docs
- Another great Ressource. An awesome free book about writing a compiler/interpreter and it's inner workings: https://craftinginterpreters.com/
